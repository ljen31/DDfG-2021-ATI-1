### Visualizing the STEM education racialgap with the Antiracist Tech Initiative @ BU's Center for Antiracist Technology

## Partner

“The Boston University Center for Antiracist Research represents a collaborative research and education effort across multiple disciplines to build a world where racial equity and social justice prevail.” The Antiracist Tech Initiative “aims to build antiracist organizations across the entire tech ecosystem…by working in interdisciplinary research teams, partnering with practitioners, policymakers, and advocates, harnessing big data, and testing evidence-based solutions to determine what policies and actions create antiracist organizations.”

## Problem Statement

The ATI is looking to use data to help promote action focused on addressing the racial gap in STEM education. They want to help the public (and particularly people in power to change structures and policies) understand the disparities and change their views about what can be done.
